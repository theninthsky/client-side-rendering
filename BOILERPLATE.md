# Using as a Boilerplate

This project can be easily turned into a production-ready boilerplate by following the next steps:

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/theninthsky/client-side-rendering.git
npm i
npm run boilerplatify
```

## Adjustments

### Sitemap

To automatically generate a sitemap, replace the `https://example.com` hostname in _[create-sitemap.js](scripts/create-sitemap.js)_ with your own hostname.
<br>
To handle dynamic routes, modify the script to first fetch the dynamic routes and then add them to the `paths` array.

Here is an example: https://github.com/theninthsky/client-side-rendering/blob/main/scripts/create-sitemap.js

### Static Assets

Static assets can be fetched and stored in the CDN during the build process, allowing them to be served very quickly.
<br>
The asset generation process should take place in _[fetch-static.js](scripts/fetch-static.js)_.

Here is an example that fetches static data a stores it under `public/json`: https://github.com/theninthsky/client-side-rendering/blob/main/scripts/fetch-static.js

## Features

Abiding by this boilerplate's requirements grants you the following features:

- [Extreme vendors splitting for better cache persistence](https://github.com/theninthsky/client-side-rendering#caching)
- [Code-splitting](https://github.com/theninthsky/client-side-rendering#code-splitting)
- [Preloading of current page scripts](https://github.com/theninthsky/client-side-rendering#preloading-async-pages)
- [Prefetching of all scripts for instant navigations](https://github.com/theninthsky/client-side-rendering#prefetching-async-pages)
- [Preloading of data](https://github.com/theninthsky/client-side-rendering#preloading-data)
- [Prerendering for perfect SEO](https://github.com/theninthsky/client-side-rendering#prerendering)

## Requirements

Tools that optimize for performance usually require the developer to follow a set of rules to "help" them do it.

For example: Next.js and Remix require you to use their file-based routers in order to be able to apply automatic code-splitting and other optimizations, and modern frameworks require the use of signals (which sometimes feel a little unintuitive) to skip full-tree rerenders.

This boilerplate is no exception, thus it requires **two** things in order to fully apply its optimizations:

1. **Lazily loading all pages and giving them unique names**.
2. **Maintaining the _[pages](src/pages.js)_, a file that specifies the chunk names, paths and data to preload**.

### Naming Async Chunks (Pages)

Async chunks can be easily named using [Webpack's magic comments](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#magic-comments):

_[App.tsx](src/App.tsx)_

```js
const Home = lazy(() => import(/* webpackChunkName: 'home' */ 'pages/Home'))
const LoremIpsum = lazy(() => import(/* webpackChunkName: 'lorem-ipsum' */ 'pages/LoremIpsum'))
```

This will create both `home.[hash].js` and `lorem-ipsum.[hash].js` files (instead of the default, cryptic, `[id].[hash].js` files).

### The Pages Manifest File Structure

To best describe what properties should be in the _pages_ file, we'll use a TypeScript-like definition:

_[pages.js](src/pages.js)_

```js
[
  {
    chunk: string
    path: string
    data?:
      {
        url: string | ((params: { [x: string]: string }) => string)
        crossorigin?: string
        preconnectURL?: string
      }[]
  }
]
```

`chunk` is the unique page name we chose via magic comments. The name "main" cannot be used.

`path` is the pathname of the page (like `/`, `/about`, `/posts`...).

`data` can be supplied if the page has dynamic data that will be fetched right when it loads.

`url` is the data API URL. Can be a string or a function that receives the dynamic path params and returns a string.

For example:

```js
{
    chunk: 'products',
    path: '/products/:category/:page',
    data: {
      url: ({ category, page }) => `https://www.my-api.com/products/${category}/${page}`
    }
  }
```

`crossorigin` is for _[CORS-enabled fetches](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/preload#cors-enabled_fetches)_.

`preconnectURL` is for cases where the fetch request will be followed by requests to resources from a different origin.

## Recommendations

### Styling

You should use _[@emotion/css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emotion/css)_ as your styling solution.

This package is the perfect balance between potential and performance, between "styled components" and CSS modules.
<br>
It can even be used to mimic the API of CSS modules and thus allow for easy migration:

```js
import { css, cx } from '@emotion/css'

import Back from './Back'

const Title = ({ className, back, children, ...otherProps }) => {
  return (
    <div {...otherProps}>
      {back && <Back className={style.back} />}

      <h1 className={cx(style.wrapper, className)}>{children}</h1>
    </div>
  )
}

const style = {
  wrapper: css`
    font-weight: 500;
    color: var(--primary-color);
  `,
  back: css`
    margin-right: 20px;
  `
}

export default Title
```

_Note that if you choose to use CSS modules instead, you should *NOT* extract CSS to separate files (typically done by [mini-css-extract-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mini-css-extract-plugin))._
<br>
_Despite the fact that the advantages of this extraction are mostly negligible nowadays, when used together with code-splitting, it will produce severe styling override issues with shared components._
